# 基于RNN和Lotka-Volterra模型对于受干旱影响的植物群落分析

**摘要：**近年来，极端气候频繁出现，对于植物群落造成极大的影响，例如干旱对于草场的影响便十分的明显。研究表明，物种的数量将对在干旱条件下植物群落的适应性产生影响，多物种生长的群落对于干旱的适应性强于单物种群落。本文将就植物在不规则天气中的表现，包括干旱与降水丰富的情形，通过RNN与Lotka-Volterra模型（捕食者-猎物模型），模拟单个植物种群在复杂气候下的生长情况与多物种群落之间的相互影响。





### Data sources and Introduction

The data in this article are from the official USGS（United States Geological Survey）website, the name of the data set is 'Precipitation, soil moisture, and vegetation data from 36 experimental plots in southeastern Utah, near Canyonlands National Park (2015 - 2018)'. These data were compiled for a study that investigated the effects of drought seasonality and plant community composition on two dominant perennial grasses,  Achnatherum hymenoides (C3 photosynthesis), and Pleuraphis jamesii (C4 photosynthesis),  Achnatherum hymenoides (C3 photosynthesis), and Pleuraphis jamesii (C4 photosynthesis), in a dryland ecosystem. In 2015 USGS Ecologists recorded vegetation and soil moisture data in 36 experimental plots which manipulated precipitation in two plant community types. The experiment consisted of three precipitation treatments: control (ambient precipitation), cool-season drought (-66% ambient precipitation November-April), and warm-season drought (-66% ambient precipitation May-October), applied in two plant communities (perennial grasses with or without a large shrub, Ephedra viridis) over a three-year period. These data were collected from 2015 to 2018 near Canyonlands National Park, UT. These data represent precipitation, soil moisture, greenness and biomass from experimental treatments. These data can be used to compare the effects of drought seasonality on muti-species plant community.

In the dataset, the following series of data and  are available:
